# 🏡 DomusMind – Intelligent Home Assistant with Modular Agents

The name DomusMind combines the Latin word Domus (meaning “home”) with Mind, symbolizing intelligence, awareness, and adaptability. This fusion conveys the essence of an intelligent home environment, where technology seamlessly integrates with daily life.

DomusMind represents more than just automation; it embodies a smart ecosystem that thinks, adapts, and evolves with its users. By emphasizing modular agents, the system highlights flexibility and scalability, enabling customized solutions for different household needs — from energy efficiency and security to personalized comfort and connectivity.

> **Local-first smart home system** with voice, vision, and language intelligence.  
> Your house **listens, sees, understands, speaks, searches — and now controls lights.**

## ✨ Overview

`pinica_ia` is a modular and agent-based home automation framework that integrates:

- 🎙️ Real-time speech transcription with Whisper
- 👁️ Vision detection using YOLOv8 (via OpenCV)
- 🧠 Local LLM-based reasoning using Ollama + Phi-4
- 🗣️ Natural speech responses using Facebook MMS-TTS
- 🌐 Web search agent via DuckDuckGo
- 💡 Device control via **Home Assistant (Sonoff supported)**
- 📊 Optional UI with Django (in development)

---

## 🧠 Agent Architecture

Each function is encapsulated as an **independent agent**, orchestrated asynchronously:

```
[🎙️ AudioAgent] → Captures & transcribes speech
         │
         ▼
[🧠 IntentClassifierAgent] → Detects wake word + classifies intent
         │
 ┌───────┴────────────────────┐
 ▼                            ▼
[👁️ VisionAgent]       [🌐 SearchAgent]
         │                     │
         ▼                     ▼
     Scene summary        Web search results
         │                     │
         └──────┬──────────────┘
                ▼
           [🧠 LLMAgent] → Generates response
                │
                ▼
          [🗣️ SpeechAgent] → Speaks back
```

## 📦 Core Components

| Agent/Class            | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `AudioAgent`           | Captures microphone audio and transcribes using Whisper                    |
| `VisionAgent`          | Detects people/objects via camera and describes scene with YOLOv8          |
| `LLMAgent`             | Handles user interaction via prompt + context using Ollama (Phi-4, etc.)   |
| `SpeechAgent`          | Converts response text into audio using Coqui TTS                          |
| `SearchAgent`          | Searches the internet with DuckDuckGo and returns structured results       |
| `IntentClassifierAgent`| Uses a local LLM to detect if input has "coca" and which action to perform |
| `HomeAssistantUtils`   | Controls smart devices via Home Assistant REST API                         |
| `main.py`              | Async orchestration and command pipeline                                   |

## 🧩 Home Assistant Integration

Pinica IA now integrates with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to control devices like **Sonoff switches**.

- Uses the **local REST API** with long-lived token authentication.
- Devices must be configured in Home Assistant and mapped to rooms.
- New field `light_entity_id` added in `configs/rooms.json`:

```json
{
  "escritorio": {
    "mic_device": 4,
    "cameras": ["rtsp://..."],
    "mqtt_topic": "casa/escritorio",
    "light_entity_id": "switch.sonoff_10013abe9c_1"
  }
}
```

> Support for more Home Assistant services (climate, locks, etc.) coming soon.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/pinica_ia.git
cd pinica_ia
```

### 2. Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start support services (if using Docker)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Configure your environment

Edit `configs/rooms.json`:

```json
{
  "sala": {
    "mic_device": 2,
    "cameras": ["rtsp://user:pass@192.168.1.20:554/stream"],
    "mqtt_topic": "home/sala",
    "light_entity_id": "switch.sonoff_sala"
  }
}
```

Update `.env` with your Home Assistant token:

```env
TOKEN=your_home_assistant_token
HASS_URL=http://localhost:8123
```

### 5. Run the assistant

```bash
uvicorn app.api.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
streamlit run main.py
```

## 🗣️ Example Spoken Commands

| Transcription Example                               | Resulting Action                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| “Coca, what's in the camera?”                       | VisionAgent runs, takes image, describes people/scene       |
| “Koka, turn on the light in the office”             | Sends request to HA to turn on `switch.sonoff_...`          |
| “Hey Coka, search the internet for pinica project”  | DuckDuckGo search executed + summary spoken                 |
| “Desligar todas as luzes, Coca”                     | (Upcoming) Multi-device HA control pipeline                 |
| “Finalize assistant, Coca”                          | Assistant shuts down gracefully                             |

## 🔐 Privacy & Wake Word

- Assistant only responds if a variation of “coca” is heard (e.g., “koka”, “coka”, “kouka”).
- All processing is done locally unless a web search is required.
- Searches and audio logs are saved in separate folders for auditability.
